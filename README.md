# everything

A module containing everything. For example:

```py
from everything import *

print(sys.path) # sys is imported

```

Now you have imported every module on the system. Good luck.

## Installation

```sh
pip install import-everything
```

Looks like PyPI doesn't allow "everything" as a package name as it's "exploitable".
